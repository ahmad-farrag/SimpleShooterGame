We need to create Pawn blueprint class "call it whatever" and create a character class "call it whatever" then under character blue print under mesh
 we can change the skeletal mesh to the character you have, and btw if you want to work in both C++ and blueprints you have to first go create C++ classes.
then create the blueprints classes to inherit from the C++ classes you've just created, after we add our skeletal mesh we can move it to be facing the same way.
and standing in the same point, then create a Gamemode blueprint class and open and change the default pawn to be the blueprint character class we created 
that inherited from the C++ class. then in our "copied" new map we can change the game mode to be the game mode we created.
and check that our playerstart after play "after ejecting with f8" is our character.


And regarding movements of the character you can head to project settings and under axis binding you get to create the move up and down and right and left and looking up
and down and left and right. and under action mapping you get to action bind the jump. The Jump function is already implemented in the character class.
all we have to do is just to call it.
for example -> PlayerInputComponent->BindAction(TEXT("Jump"), EInputEvent::IE_Pressed,this, &ACharacter::Jump);
as for moving forward-> PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis(TEXT("MoveForward"), this, &AShooterCharacter::MoveForward);
same goes for the rest of the directions.

We Add Camera and Spring arm in the BP Character and enable pawn rotation on the spring arm. now we have our 3rd person camera working correctly.

We Create an animation blueprint and a 2D Blend Space. in the blend spaced we set up the angle to be between -180 to 180 in the horizontal axes to be around backwards,
left, forward, right and backwards animations and the vertical axes to be between 0 to 100 and to be around standing still animation at 0.
and in the animation graph in the animation blueprint we hook up the blend space to the Output Pose and create 2 local variables of float type for the angle and speed.
and then heading to the event graph to get velocity of the owner (Our Pawn) and set the animation based on the speed of the player.
And to Complete setting up basic movement animation to set the angle of our animation we need first to GetActorTransform and inverseTransformDirection 
and GetRotation from that vector "only getting the yawing value".

We need to create an Actor C++ class for the gune and create a blueprint that inherits from it.. and then set up the skeletal mesh 
for example-> 	Root = CreateDefaultSubobject<USceneComponent>(TEXT("Root"));
	SetRootComponent(Root);
	Mesh=CreateDefaultSubobject<USkeletalMeshComponent>(TEXT("Mesh"));
	Mesh->SetupAttachment(Root);

Then we need to create a Shooting function that only has Gun->PullTrigger();
and UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAttached(MuzzleFlash, Mesh, TEXT("MuzzleFlashSocket"));
MuzzleFlashSocket is the name of the socked of the rifle that we want the particle to spawn from .. and before we spawn the particle we can first test that "pull rigger" works by just logging
UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("We're shooting"));

-Drawing Debug Cameras 
Drawing Debug Camera to let us know how to set up line tracing to further enhance our aiming mechanism that we're about to set up.
To draw debug cameras, we first need to #include "DrawDebugHelpers.h"
then inside the shooting function in our Actor Gun C++ class

	APawn* OwnerPawn = Cast<APawn>(GetOwner());
	if (OwnerPawn == nullptr) return;
	AController* OwnerController = OwnerPawn->GetController();
	if (OwnerController == nullptr) return;

	FVector Location;
	FRotator Rotation;
	OwnerController->GetPlayerViewPoint(Location, Rotation);

	DrawDebugCamera(GetWorld(), Location, Rotation, 90, 2, FColor::Red, true);

Starting up we need to head to Project Settings->Collision->Trace Channels->New Trace Channel "give it a name".
Default Response -> Block "meaning all object types are going to block unless we specify otherwise"

and for the Preset-> No Collision-> ignore bullet,
OverlapAll->Overlap bullet, Invisible wall and invisible wall dynamic->ignore bullet.

We need to comment 	//DrawDebugCamera(GetWorld(), Location, Rotation, 90, 2, FColor::Red, true); 
Cause we no longer need to draw debug cameras we know it‚Äôs working we need to draw debug point 

	FVector End = Location + Rotation.Vector() * MaxRange;
	// TODO: LineTrace
	FHitResult Hit;
	bool bSuccess = GetWorld()->LineTraceSingleByChannel(Hit, Location, End, ECollisionChannel::ECC_GameTraceChannel1);
	if (bSuccess)
	{
		DrawDebugPoint(GetWorld(), Hit.Location, 20, FColor::Red, true);
	}
We can in the Gun Actor C++ header file set Max Range for 1000 for example

-ùëØùíÜùíÇùíçùíïùíâ& ùë´ùíÇùíéùíÇùíàùíÜ ùë∫ùíöùíîùíïùíÜùíé

To Add an Impact Particle Effect and Set up Dealing Damage and Health we need to:
comment out or remove->DrawDebugPoint(GetWorld(), Hit.Location, 20, FColor::Red, true);
and instead 

		FVector ShotDirection = -Rotation.Vector();
		UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAtLocation(GetWorld(), ImpactEffect, Hit.Location, ShotDirection.Rotation());

		AActor* HitActor = Hit.GetActor();
		if (HitActor != nullptr)
		{
			FPointDamageEvent DamageEvent(Damage, Hit, ShotDirection, nullptr);
			HitActor->TakeDamage(Damage, DamageEvent, OwnerController, this);
		}

We can in the Gun Actor C++ header file set Damage to 10 for example

And in the ShooterCharacter.cpp we need to set Health to be equal to MaxHealth in BeginPlay and set them both up in the header file 
as UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly) for MaxHealth which is equal to One Hundered for example and set the float Health to be UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere).

We of course need a function to check the state of our player or Ai if ‚Äúis Dead?‚Äù or not 
and it has simple implementation of 

bool AShooterCharacter::IsDead() const
{
	return Health <= 0;
}
And it‚Äôs a UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure) 
in the ABP in the AnimGraph we need to use the blend by pool, and create a Boolean local variable "isDead" if false we need to hook in the locomotion for our movement and if true we hook in death animation, and then in C++ create a blueprint pure function for isDead and call it in the EventGraph but first we need to cast the owner to Shooter Character C++ class to be able to use the function.

-ùë∫ùíÜùíïùíïùíäùíèùíà ùíñùíë ùë®ùë∞

First we will create a C++ class of type "AI Controller" MAKE SURE you search for that in the C++ Classes" we will name it "ShooterAIController" and then we will create a blue print class of type "ShooterAIController" and call it "BP_ShooterAIController" Then in the C++ ShooterAiController we include #include "Kismet/GameplayStatics.h" to use a very useful function to get the PlayerPawn 
UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerPawn(GetWorld(), 0); SetFocus(PlayerPawn); "makes Ai track our player"
But it‚Äôs there for testing we will use Behavior Tree& Blackboard to set up our Ai but first we need to add a NavMeshBoundsVolume so that the Ai knows where he's allowed to follow us and search for us. 

    if (AIBehavior != nullptr)
    {
        RunBehaviorTree(AIBehavior);
    }
To Hook in our Behavior Tree, As for the blackboard We are setting the player location "vector" in the blackboard and naming it the same name we set in our C++ class.
        APawn* PlayerPawn = UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerPawn(GetWorld(), 0);
        GetBlackboardComponent()->SetValueAsVector(TEXT("PlayerLocation"), PlayerPawn->GetActorLocation());
        GetBlackboardComponent()->SetValueAsVector(TEXT("StartLocation"), GetPawn()->GetActorLocation()); 

And now we have our Ai Behavior Tree tracking our player's location, And we have the start location of the Ai possesed pawn, then we can add some tasks in the behavior tree sequence we can make Ai patrol by "move to", "wait" then "move to" get back to start location .. then probably "wait" again. just as a start to setting up the tasks in the behavior tree.

And instead of one sequence that has Move to , wait , move to , wait we use a selector and then a sequence "chase" it's decorator is a condition "Blackboard" it's key is the player location and if found we move to player location "task" if not found then the selector will investigate "another sequence that has the task "move to last known player location". And in order to always keep track of the player location we need to move it to tick instead of begin play in the C++ Ai Class, and use a clear value for the player location if he is not the line of sight.

Also the main code to setting Line of sight in the Ai Controller C++ class is 

    APawn* PlayerPawn = UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerPawn(GetWorld(), 0);

    if (LineOfSightTo(PlayerPawn))
    {
        GetBlackboardComponent()->SetValueAsVector(TEXT("PlayerLocation"), PlayerPawn->GetActorLocation());
        GetBlackboardComponent()->SetValueAsVector(TEXT("LastKnownPlayerLocation"), PlayerPawn->GetActorLocation());
    }
    else
    {
        GetBlackboardComponent()->ClearValue(TEXT("PlayerLocation"));
    }


Note that Creating Custom task based on blackboard requires first adding "GameplayTasks" to "PublicDependencyModuleNames" in the "*.build.cs" and to change its name "task name" -> NodeName = TEXT(""); Remember that ClearValue takes an FName and we search through the documentation to finally get a grasp of what we need to use here. "BehaviorTreeTypes.h" ,"BTTaskNode.h".

And to set up Ai to shoot in our Behavior Tree we first we will create a C++ class and it's a TaskNode this time not a BlackBoard one "cause we don't need a key" .. After implementing the Shooting method in C++ we can't add it as a task in the chase sequence otherwise he will shoot indefinitely. but instead we make a new sequence with an infinite loop decorator that shoots then waits for 1 sec or less.

UBTTask_Shoot::UBTTask_Shoot()
{
    NodeName = "Shoot";
}

EBTNodeResult::Type UBTTask_Shoot::ExecuteTask(UBehaviorTreeComponent& OwnerComp, uint8* NodeMemory)
{
    Super::ExecuteTask(OwnerComp, NodeMemory);

    if (OwnerComp.GetAIOwner() == nullptr)
    {
        return EBTNodeResult::Failed;
    }

    AShooterCharacter* Character = Cast<AShooterCharacter>(OwnerComp.GetAIOwner()->GetPawn());
    if (Character == nullptr)
    {
        return EBTNodeResult::Failed;
    }

    Character->Shoot();

    return EBTNodeResult::Succeeded;
}
